# Phil Brockwell

I am a Junior Web/Mobile Developer in London, who stumbled accross the intricacies of computer science a few years ago. My keen attitude for problem solving, thirst for learning, and interest in all things technological, lead me to a decision to take the red pill and embark on a new career.

# Who am I?

I have spent the last ten years of my career working in the building industry, largely as a Self Employed Plumber. Throughout this career I was able to achieve many goals and targets, such as securing my first mortgage. By running my own business I also learnt a lot about time management, workflow and self promotion. However I had always felt a sense of discontentment and realised that this was not how I planned to spend the rest of my working life.

Three years ago, I built my first website using an online template. I quickly decided this was a career path I wanted to pursue further. This prompted me to enrol in a full time Computer Science Degree with the Greenwich School of Management, and later to dedicate 12 weeks to a full time intensive web development course with the Makers Academy.
